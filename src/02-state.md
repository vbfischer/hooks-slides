## React State

* State vs Props
  * State ==> internal
  * Props ==> external

notes: 
Webapps are data driven. Data in React can be broken down into 2 main categories: 

* State
* Props

state and props are just data for your components. The only difference is that State is something internal to the component. Meaning that it is data that only it cares about and manages.

Props is data passed from its parent component.
